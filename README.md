# SQLAnalysis

Analyse Covid 19 deaths on global scale using Microsoft SQL server. In this project I have used pyodbc driver to connect to a local istance of SQL server and used pandas for analyzing the obtained results from the SQL Queries and Plotly for visualizations.
Note: Data is downloaded from the website https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and loaded to Microsoft SQL Server
